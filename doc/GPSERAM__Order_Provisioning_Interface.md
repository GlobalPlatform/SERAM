Order Provisioning Interface
============================

A [Management Session](GPSERAM__Terminology_And_Definitions.md#ManagementSession)  relies on the knowledge of a shared [sessionId](GPSERAM__Terminology_And_Definitions.md#sessionId) by the [Local Agent](GPSERAM__Terminology_And_Definitions.md#LocalAgent) and the [Remote Agent](GPSERAM__Terminology_And_Definitions.md#RemoteAgent). It's far beyond the scope of GP SERAM to explore how, when, and by whom this [sessionId](GPSERAM__Terminology_And_Definitions.md#sessionId) is generated and shared. 

Nevertheless, it seems useful for GP SERAM ecosystem to provide a simple order provisioning interface example which may guides platform implementors or any further standardization efforts.


Provisioning  Endpoint
----------------------

A [Management Platform](GPSERAM__Terminology_And_Definitions.md#ManagementPlatform) may implements an order provisioning endpoint which should be an HTTP REST endpoint.

| **Endpoint**    | **GP SERAM Step**   | **Description**                                     |
|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| /order          | Initialization Step | Management Session creation and order provisioning  |


Order Operations
----------------

The order provisioning interface consists of an HTTP request and response pair used to generate a new Management Session.

The request shall be an HTTP POST request on the Provisioning Endpoint with these optional parameters as JSON body :
- a list of `secureElement`,
- a `sessionID`,
- a `remoteManagementOrder`.

To provide multiple orders the same `sessionID` shall be used.

On success, the associated HTTP response shall be an HTTP `201` response with a JSON body consisting of the `sessionID` if it is generated by the Management Platform, or with a null body if has been provided in the HTTP request.

All these fields are defined in [HTTP REST Binding - OpenAPI specification](spec/gpseram.yaml) ([Viewer](https://globalplatform.github.io/SERAM/)).


Security
--------

The order provisioning interface shall implement a *security scheme* as defined by [OpenAPI](doc/GPSERAM__References.md).
